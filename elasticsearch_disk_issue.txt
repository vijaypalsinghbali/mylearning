Elasticsearch disk issue >  in dev tools run below commands:
When disk is high for elasticsearch server , and and is 90% , ES automatical turns 
index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": true for all indexes to avoid further disk usage , 
Clean the disk from Index management by deleting old indexes 200GB or more etc. 
Then
We need to run 
PUT /_all/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null
  }
}
Now files could be written , because logs are blocked at ES , the buffer gets chocked on forwarders, so we need to restart td-agent to drop all the buffers

Check everything in monitoring  - in overview

IMP commands:

GET /_cluster/health?pretty

GET /_settings?pretty

PUT /seller-ib-int-2025.02.15/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null
  }
}


PUT /_all/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null
  }
}
